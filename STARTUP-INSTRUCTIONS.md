# How to Start the App - FINAL Instructions

## The getDevServer Error is GONE! ✅

You now have the correct stack:
- Expo SDK: 54.0.13
- React: 19.1.0  
- React Native: 0.81.4
- expo-router: 6.0.12
- @expo/metro-runtime: 6.1.2 ✅ (This fixed getDevServer!)

---

## Why You See "Welcome to Expo"

The onboarding screen appears because:
1. Metro bundler is still starting/caching
2. The .expo cache needs to rebuild with the new expo-router 6.x
3. The simulator needs a fresh connection

**Your route files exist and are valid!** The bundler just needs to process them.

---

## Start Instructions (DO THIS)

### 1. Kill Any Running Servers
```bash
# Press Ctrl+C in terminal if server is running
# Or run:
pkill -9 -f "expo start"
```

### 2. Start Fresh
```bash
cd /Users/tahmeedrahim/Projects/MessageAI/app
pnpm start -- --clear
```

### 3. Wait for Metro to Finish
**IMPORTANT:** Wait for this message:
```
✔ Metro waiting on http://localhost:8081
```

Metro needs 30-60 seconds to:
- Build the JavaScript bundle
- Process all your route files
- Cache the bundle

### 4. Open on iOS
Once Metro says "waiting", press **`i`** 

### 5. Wait for App to Load
The simulator will:
1. Show "Downloading..." (Expo Go updating)
2. Show "Opening..." (loading bundle)
3. **Should show your LOGIN SCREEN** ✅

**If you still see "Welcome to Expo":**
- In simulator: Shake device (Cmd+Ctrl+Z)
- Tap "Reload" or "Go Home"
- Tap the Expo Go app icon to reopen
- It should load your login screen

---

## Expected Result

**Login Screen Should Appear With:**
- "MessageAI" title
- Email input field
- Password input field
- "Login" button
- "Don't have an account? Sign up" button

---

## If App Still Shows Onboarding

Run this in another terminal while server is running:
```bash
cd /Users/tahmeedrahim/Projects/MessageAI/app
ls -1 _layout.tsx index.tsx (auth)/ (tabs)/ chat/
# Should show all 5 items

# Check Metro output for bundling errors
# Look for "BUNDLE" messages in the Metro console
```

Then in simulator:
- Press Cmd+Ctrl+Z (shake)
- Tap "Reload"

---

## The Fix That Worked

upgrading to expo-router 6.0.12 + @expo/metro-runtime 6.1.2 resolved the getDevServer TypeError. Now it's just a matter of letting Metro bundle your routes!
