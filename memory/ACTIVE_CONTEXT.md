## Project Structure ⚠️ CRITICAL: Nested app/ Directory

**Expo Router Convention:** All routes MUST live in `app/app/` subdirectory!

**WHY NESTED?** Expo Router by default searches for routes in an `app/` subdirectory within your project root. This allows separation of routes from configuration files.

## Key Files
- `app/app/_layout.tsx` - Root layout (Expo Router entry) ✔ NESTED!
- `app/app/index.tsx` - Home screen ✔ NESTED!
- `app/app/(auth)/login.tsx` + `signup.tsx` - Auth screens ✔ NEW
- `app/app/(tabs)/profile.tsx` - User profile ✔ NEW
- `app/app/chat/[id].tsx` - Chat room (updated to PRD schema)
- `app/src/lib/firebase.ts` - Firebase init + offline persistence
- `app/src/lib/messageService.ts` - CRUD with PRD schema

## Current Status & Next Actions

### Deployment Status:
- ✅ Firebase Blaze Plan enabled
- ✅ Cloud Functions deployed successfully
  - Runtime: Node.js 20 (upgraded from deprecated Node 18)
  - Function: sendMessageNotification(us-central1)
  - Status: Live and operational
  - Added @google-cloud/functions-framework dependency
- ✅ All Firebase services configured and deployed
  - Firestore rules ✅
  - Storage rules ✅
  - Firestore indexes ✅
  - Cloud Functions ✅
- ✅ Expo Go dev server running (for UI/UX testing)
- ⏳ Physical device build pending (ready to build with eas build)

### Immediate Next Steps:
1. ✅ Cloud Functions deployed (Node.js 20)
2. Build for iPhone: eas build --profile development --platform ios
3. Install on device: eas build:run -p ios (or scan QR from build page)
4. Login to app to register push token
5. Get token from console logs or Firebase Console (users/{uid}/pushToken)
6. Test with Expo Push Tool: https://expo.dev/notifications
7. Verify foreground and background notifications work
8. Execute remaining E2E scenarios from MANUAL-TEST-CHECKLIST.md

### For Testing Without Push (Available Now):
- ✅ Use Expo Go (scan QR code from terminal)
- ✅ Test all UI/UX features
- ✅ Test messaging, friends, groups, offline sync
- ✅ Push notifications will gracefully skip (device check)

## Testing Commands
```bash
cd app
pnpm test          # Run all tests (73/73)
pnpm jest --coverage  # Run with coverage (49%)
pnpm start         # Start dev server
npx tsc --noEmit   # TypeScript check (0 errors)
npx expo run:ios   # Build dev client (iOS)
npx expo run:android  # Build dev client (Android)
```

## Import Pattern
Use @ alias for all src imports:
```typescript
import { useAuth } from '@/hooks/useAuth';
import { Message } from '@/types/index';
import { addFriend } from '@/services/friendService';
```
