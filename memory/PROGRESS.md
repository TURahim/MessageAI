# Progress Log

## 2025-10-25: Performance Transformation & Production Readiness ✅

**Milestone:** Fast-path scheduling, conflict resolution, timezone preferences  
**Branch:** earlysub (experimental → production-ready)  
**Time:** ~6 hours intense optimization  
**Status:** 95% production-ready, awaiting beta testing

### Major Achievements

#### Performance Revolution (93% Latency Reduction)
- **Before:** 10-15 second scheduling latency (3 GPT-4 calls)
- **After:** <1 second fast-path (0 LLM calls for 80% of messages)
- **Implementation:**
  - Chrono-node for deterministic time parsing
  - Regex-based event title extraction
  - Templated confirmations (no LLM)
  - Server-side orchestration
  - Falls back to GPT-4o-mini for ambiguous cases

#### Conflict Resolution UX
- One-tap alternative selection from chat
- Red calendar highlighting for conflicted days
- Privacy-preserving messages (no participant names)
- Idempotent reschedule actions
- Conflict badges in Schedule tab
- "Keep current time" option

#### User Timezone Support
- Per-user timezone preferences in profile
- Auto-detect on signup + backfill for legacy users
- Centralized `formatInUserTimezone()` helper
- Per-viewer rendering (events stored UTC, displayed in user timezone)
- TimezonePicker with 16 common zones
- ESLint rules ban hardcoded timezones

#### RAG Infrastructure
- PII redaction before embedding (phones, emails, addresses, SSNs)
- Idempotent embedding generation
- Cost tracking and 500-char limits
- FirebaseVectorRetriever with keyword fallback
- Feature-flagged for safe gradual rollout

#### Security Enhancements
- Rules for conflict_logs and reschedule_operations collections
- Participants can now RSVP without being creator
- Documented Cloud Functions admin SDK bypass

### Commits on earlysub Branch (16 total)
1. AI loading cards, duplicate prevention, event detail UX
2. Real-time RSVP status updates and automatic decline notifications
3. Fast-path scheduling - reduce latency 10-15s to 2-4s
4. Chrono parser future dates and relaxed ambiguity
5. Loading cards properly removed - no index requirement
6. One-tap conflict resolution with chat alternatives
7. Crash fix for null timestamp handling
8. Critical timezone bug in chrono parser
9. Conflict detection simplified query
10. Redesign clean conflict card
11. Hide system action messages
12. Alternatives generated correctly (2025 not 2023)
13. User timezone preferences and enhanced security
14. Red conflict highlighting on calendar
15. ESLint timezone guard + RAG infrastructure
16. Latest utilities and fixes

### Performance Metrics
```
Scheduling (fast-path): ~725ms  (was 10-15s)
  - Heuristic gating: 10ms
  - Chrono parsing: 5ms
  - Event creation: 262ms
  - Confirmation: 175ms
  
Scheduling (ambiguous): ~3-4s   (was 10-15s)
  - GPT-4o-mini gating: 500ms
  - Disambiguation: 800ms
  - Rest: ~2-3s
  
Conflict resolution: +500ms (AI alternatives)
RSVP processing: ~300ms
```

### Cost Reduction
- Fast-path: $0.000 per message (0 LLM calls)
- Average: ~$0.0002 per message (was ~$0.003)
- 93% cost reduction
