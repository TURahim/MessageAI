### Metrics
- **Files Created:** 102
- **Lines of Code:** ~14,267
- **Tests:** 4/4 passing
- **Test Coverage:** ChatRoomScreen core features
- **Time Spent:** ~4 hours

### Technical Decisions
1. **Offline Persistence:** Used persistentLocalCache (not SQLite)
2. **Message IDs:** Client-generated UUIDs for idempotency
3. **State Management:** React hooks (no Redux yet)
4. **Testing:** Jest + RTL (no E2E yet)
5. **Monorepo:** pnpm workspace for scalability

### Challenges Resolved
1. **TypeScript Errors:** Fixed with jsx, esModuleInterop config
2. **Test Failures:** Babel preset and version conflicts resolved
3. **Nested Git:** Removed app/.git to fix submodule issue
4. **Firebase Persistence:** Fixed API signature for persistentSingleTabManager
5. **Mock Setup:** Added messageId mock for tests

  - Updated to PRD-compliant schema (Message, User, Conversation)
  - Created firestore.indexes.json
  - Deployed Firestore rules + indexes
  - Flattened directory structure (removed nested app/app/)

### Metrics
- **Files Modified:** 21
- **Dependencies Removed:** 2 (React Navigation)
- **Dependencies Added:** 5 (expo-router, expo-image-picker, expo-notifications, expo-linking, module-resolver)
- **Packages Installed:** 968 (all in app/node_modules, no hoisting)
- **Tests:** 13/13 passing
- **TypeScript:** 0 errors
- **Time:** ~7 hours (including troubleshooting)

## Troubleshooting Completed (2+ hours)
- Metro "getDevServer is not a function" error resolved
- Root cause: expo-router 6.x needed @expo/metro-runtime 6.x
- Solution: Upgraded to correct SDK 54 package versions
- Nuclear reset: All simulators, caches, dependencies
- Final stack: Expo 54 + RN 0.81.4 + React 19.1 + expo-router 6.0.12

## 2025-10-20 - Expo Router "Welcome to Expo" Fix ✅

### Problem
- App showed "Welcome to Expo" screen instead of loading routes
- Routes were not being found by Expo Router

### Root Cause
- Expo Router by default looks for routes in `app/` subdirectory
- Routes were at project root level, not in nested `app/app/` directory
- Metro was bundling with `transform.routerRoot=app` parameter

### Solution
- Moved ALL routes into `app/app/` subdirectory:
  - `_layout.tsx` and `index.tsx`
  - `(auth)/` directory with login/signup
  - `(tabs)/` directory with chats list/profile
  - `chat/` directory with dynamic [id] route
- Removed `experiments.routerRoot` from app.json (use default behavior)
- Cleared all caches (.expo, node_modules/.cache)

### Critical Learning
**NEVER flatten the nested app/app/ structure!**
- This is Expo Router's default convention (SDK 50+)
- Allows separation of routes from config files
- If routes aren't loading, verify they're in `app/app/`, NOT project root

### Files Changed
- Moved: `app/_layout.tsx` → `app/app/_layout.tsx`
- Moved: `app/index.tsx` → `app/app/index.tsx`
- Moved: `app/(auth)/` → `app/app/(auth)/`
- Moved: `app/(tabs)/` → `app/app/(tabs)/`
- Moved: `app/chat/` → `app/app/chat/`
- Updated: `app/app.json` (removed routerRoot experiment)

### Result
✅ App now loads correctly with "MessageAI Works!" screen
✅ Expo Router functioning properly with file-based routing
✅ Ready to implement conversation features

  - Real-time message sync working
  - lastMessage updates in conversation list
