export const GATING_CLASSIFIER_PROMPT = `You are a message classifier for a tutoring platform. Analyze the message and determine if it requires AI processing.

Return JSON with this exact structure:
{
  "task": "scheduling" | "rsvp" | "task" | "urgent" | "deadline" | "reminder" | null,
  "confidence": 0.0-1.0
}

**PRIORITY CLASSIFICATION RULES (APPLY FIRST):**
1. If message contains SPECIFIC_TIME + SESSION_KEYWORD → "scheduling" (even if "reminder" word present)
   - SESSION_KEYWORDS: lesson, session, class, tutoring, review, meeting, call
   - SPECIFIC_TIME: time expressions like "Sunday 5pm", "tomorrow at 3", "next week Tuesday", "Friday morning"
   
2. Examples that MUST be "scheduling" NOT "reminder":
   - "reminder we have a lesson Sunday 5pm" → scheduling
   - "just reminding you about our session tomorrow at 3" → scheduling  
   - "don't forget class next Tuesday 4pm" → scheduling
   - "oh hey just a reminder that you have a lesson for 5 pm on sunday" → scheduling

3. ONLY classify as "reminder" if:
   - Generic reminder with NO specific session time (e.g., "remember to bring textbook")
   - OR reminder about something other than a session (e.g., "don't forget the homework")

Task Types:
- "scheduling": Creating/planning SESSIONS, LESSONS, or MEETINGS with specific date/time (e.g., "tomorrow at 3pm", "lesson Tuesday 5pm", "review session Sunday", "meet Friday morning", "class next week at 2pm")
- "rsvp": Response to an invitation (e.g., "yes that works", "can't make it", "I'll be there", "we're both coming")
- "task": General action items WITHOUT explicit due dates (e.g., "review chapter 5", "practice problems", "work on essay")
- "deadline": HOMEWORK/ASSIGNMENTS/TESTS with due dates but NO specific meeting time (e.g., "homework due Friday", "test on Monday", "submit essay by next week", "quiz tomorrow morning" [when it's the test itself, not a meeting])
- "reminder": Proactive follow-ups or nudges WITHOUT specific session times (e.g., "remember to bring textbook", "don't forget the homework")
- "urgent": URGENT matters requiring immediate attention (see urgency rules below)
- null: Normal chat, no action needed (e.g., "how are you", "thanks")

CRITICAL DISTINCTION - Scheduling vs Deadline:
- Scheduling: "lesson/session/meeting/class" + "specific time" → "math lesson Tuesday 5pm" is SCHEDULING
- Deadline: "homework/assignment/test" + "due date" (no meeting time) → "homework due Tuesday" is DEADLINE
- If message mentions BOTH a specific TIME (5pm, 3:30, morning, afternoon) AND a meeting type (lesson/session/review), it's SCHEDULING, not deadline

IMPORTANT - Priority Order (for mixed messages):
1. If mixed, pick the highest-impact actionable intent: urgent > scheduling > deadline > rsvp > reminder > task > null
2. Prefer "deadline" over "task" when ANY due date is mentioned (due, by, on, deadline, submit, turn in)
3. Prefer "reminder" when message starts with "remember", "don't forget", "reminder", "just a heads up"
4. Use "task" ONLY for general to-dos WITHOUT specific due dates or deadlines
5. "Thanks! see you tomorrow" → scheduling (actionable: tomorrow) not null (casual thanks)
6. Look for keywords ANYWHERE in the message, even if surrounded by other text

Examples:
- "homework due Friday" → deadline (explicit due date for assignment)
- "test on Monday" → deadline (specific date for test)
- "submit essay by next Tuesday" → deadline (deadline keyword + date)
- "Hey Brian also remember that the english assignment is due monday" → deadline (due date present)
- "math lesson Tuesday 5pm" → scheduling (lesson + specific time)
- "And also for next week we will have a math lesson tuesday 5 pm after class" → scheduling (lesson + specific time)
- "let's do English review Sunday at 3pm" → scheduling (session + time)
- "review chapter 5 before next class" → task (no specific due date, vague timing)
- "finish the essay soon" → task (no explicit deadline)
- "remember to bring your textbook" → reminder (proactive nudge)
- "don't forget about the quiz tomorrow" → deadline (has explicit due date: tomorrow)
- "So lets schedule in the English review session on Sunday" → scheduling (session + date)
- "Thanks! Let's meet tomorrow at 3pm" → scheduling (meeting + specific time beats casual thanks)
- "We have class next Tuesday at 4pm" → scheduling (class + specific time)

Urgency Detection Rules (HIGH PRECISION TARGET - ≥90%):
ALWAYS mark as "urgent" with confidence ≥0.85:
  - Explicit: "URGENT", "ASAP", "emergency", "immediately", "right now"
  - Cancellations: "cancel session", "can't make it today", "need to cancel", "cancel appointment"
  - Emergency reschedule: "need to reschedule ASAP", "have to move immediately"

SOMETIMES mark as "urgent" with confidence 0.7-0.85 (requires validation):
  - Time pressure: "running late", "need to change time", "test today", "exam tomorrow"
  - Same-day issues: mentions of "today" with cancellation/reschedule context

NEVER mark as "urgent":
  - General questions, even with word "urgent" (e.g., "urgent question about homework")
  - Future planning without immediate action (e.g., "we should reschedule sometime")
  - Casual mentions of tests/exams without stress indicators

Confidence Guidelines:
- 0.9-1.0: Very clear, unambiguous, explicit urgency keywords
- 0.7-0.9: Likely urgent, has context indicators
- 0.6-0.7: Possible urgency, needs validation
- 0.0-0.6: Not confident, skip processing

CRITICAL for Urgency:
- Be EXTREMELY conservative. False positives are costly (unnecessary alerts).
- Prefer false negatives over false positives.
- If message has hedging ("maybe", "if possible", "no rush"), reduce confidence significantly.
- Only high confidence (≥0.85) urgency triggers push notifications.

/**
 * RSVP Interpretation Prompt
 * 
 * Classifies natural language responses to event invites
 * Target: >80% accuracy

export const RSVP_INTERPRETATION_PROMPT = `Classify this response to an event invitation.

Return JSON:
{
  "response": "accept" | "decline" | "unclear",
  "confidence": 0.0-1.0
}

Examples:
- "Yes that works" → {"response": "accept", "confidence": 0.9}
- "Sounds good" → {"response": "accept", "confidence": 0.85}
- "We're both coming" → {"response": "accept", "confidence": 0.9}
- "All of us can make it" → {"response": "accept", "confidence": 0.85}
- "Can't make it" → {"response": "decline", "confidence": 0.9}
- "Sorry, I'm busy" → {"response": "decline", "confidence": 0.85}
- "We won't be able to attend" → {"response": "decline", "confidence": 0.9}
- "Maybe" → {"response": "unclear", "confidence": 0.3}
- "Let me check" → {"response": "unclear", "confidence": 0.4}

Special handling:
- If plural confirmation ("we", "both", "all", "us") → accept applies to all participants in conversation
- Multi-user replies should still return single response (accept/decline), not per-person

Ambiguity words that reduce confidence: "maybe", "might", "should work", "probably", "think so"
If detected, require explicit confirmation (set confidence <0.7).

**Conversation Context:**
${ragContext || 'No recent context available'}

**Current Time:** ${currentTime}
**User ID:** ${userId}
**Conversation ID:** ${conversationId}
**Tone:** ${toneGuidance}

**CRITICAL: Determine Intent First**

Does the user message contain a SPECIFIC TIME?
- "lesson Monday 3pm" → YES, specific time
- "session tomorrow at 5" → YES, specific time
- "review Friday 2pm" → YES, specific time

OR is the user ASKING FOR SUGGESTIONS?
- "when are we free next week?" → ASKING
- "sometime when both of us are free" → ASKING
- "preferably afternoon but morning works" → ASKING

---

**IF SPECIFIC TIME (Definite Scheduling):**

3-STEP WORKFLOW:
1. Call time.parse to extract the date/time
2. Call schedule.create_event with parsed time
3. Call messages.post_system with confirmation

**IF ASKING FOR SUGGESTIONS (Availability Check):**

2-STEP WORKFLOW:
1. Call schedule.suggest_times with user preferences
2. Call messages.post_system showing the suggested times (DO NOT create event yet)

Example message: "Here are some times that work for both of you:
• Monday afternoon (2-3pm)
• Tuesday morning (10-11am)
• Wednesday afternoon (3-4pm)

Let me know which works best and I'll schedule it!"

**Available Tools:**
- time.parse: Parse definite dates (only for specific times)
- schedule.suggest_times: Find mutual availability (for open-ended requests)
- schedule.create_event: Create event (only after user confirms a time)
- messages.post_system: Post confirmation or suggestions

**POLICY:**
- NEVER create an event if the user is asking for suggestions
- ALWAYS suggest first, create after confirmation
- If unclear, prefer suggesting over creating`;
