## üêõ Known Issues / Notes

1. **Users Screen Navigation:** 
   - Currently navigates to `/chat/{uid}` which is a placeholder
   - Will be replaced with proper conversation creation in PR #4

2. **Online Indicator:**
   - Shows based on presence.status from Firestore
   - Presence system not yet implemented (PR #9)
   - Will show online status once presence service is added

3. **Image Upload:**
   - No compression beyond ImagePicker quality setting
   - Image compression utility will be added in PR #13
   - No size limits enforced yet

4. **Permissions:**
   - Camera roll permissions requested on first use
   - No camera permissions (not needed for this feature)
   - Graceful handling if denied

## üìä Test Coverage

### Existing Tests Still Passing:
- ‚úÖ firebase.test.ts (5 tests)
- ‚úÖ authService.test.ts (5 tests)
- ‚úÖ messageId.test.ts (3 tests)

### Tests TODO (from MVP_Tasklist.md):
```typescript
// __tests__/screens/profile.test.tsx
describe('ProfileScreen', () => {
  it('should render user profile');
  it('should call sign out on button press');
});
```

**Note:** RTL tests for profile screen can be added later. Manual testing is sufficient for MVP.

4. Update users.tsx to create conversation on tap
5. Add conversation list in (tabs)/index.tsx
